# SQLx Test Migration Retrospective

For the complete retrospective of the SQLx test migration project (completed 2025-10-24), see:

**Location:** `docs/retrospectives/2025-10-24-sqlx-migration-retrospective.md`

**Summary:**
- Successfully migrated 40 SQL test assertions to Rust/SQLx framework
- Achieved 100% functional coverage (all test scenarios covered)
- 35 tests created (15 equality + 19 JSONB + 1 helper)
- All tests passing, comprehensive documentation, conventional commits throughout

**Key Learnings:**
1. Blake3 vs HMAC payload structure differences ('ob' field)
2. Batch-review pattern caught all issues before propagation
3. Infrastructure investment (helpers, docs, scripts) paid off significantly
4. Coverage metric definitions matter (functional vs execution coverage)
5. TDD approach caught setup issues early

**Process Success Factors:**
- Detailed execution plan with exact commands
- Code review checkpoint after each batch (4 batches total)
- Infrastructure-first approach (helpers, fixtures, docs)
- Clear distinction between like-for-like migration and enhancements

**Time Investment:** ~10-12 hours (full day)
**Bugs Found in Review:** 3
**Bugs Shipped:** 0
