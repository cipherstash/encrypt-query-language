### How this project is organised

Development is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), both locally and [in CI](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions).

mise has tasks for:

- Building EQL install and uninstall scripts (`build`)
- Starting and stopping PostgreSQL containers (`postgres:up`, `postgres:down`)
- Running unit and integration tests (`test`, `reset`)

These are the important files in the repo:

## Set up a local development environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you follow this how-to** you need to have this software installed:
>  - [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) ‚Äî see the [installing mise](#installing-mise) instructions
>  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ‚Äî see Docker's [documentation for installing](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

Local development quickstart:

``` shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language
cd encrypt-query-language

# Install dependencies
mise trust --yes

# Build EQL installer and uninstaller, outputting to release/
mise run build

# Start a postgres instance (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run postgres:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run test

# Stop and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

### Installing mise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

Local development and task running in CI is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

To install mise:

- If you're on macOS, run `brew install mise`
- If you're on another platform, check out the mise [installation methods documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#installation-methods)

Then add mise to your shell:

```shell
# If you're running Bash
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# If you're running Zsh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

We use [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) for faster installation of tools installed via `mise` and Cargo.
We install `cargo-binstall` via `mise` when installing development and testing dependencies.

> [!TIP]
> We provide abbreviations for most of the commands that follow.
> For example, `mise run postgres:setup` can be abbreviated to `mise r s`.
> Run `mise tasks --extended` to see the task shortcuts.

## Testing

There are tests for checking EQL against PostgreSQL versions 14‚Äì17, that verify:

- Adding, removing, and modifying encrypted data and indexes
- Validating, applying, and removing configuration for encrypted data and encrypted indexes
- Validating schemas for EQL configuration, encrypted data, and encrypted indexes
- Using PostgreSQL operators on encrypted data and indexes (`=`, `<>`, `@>`)

The easiest way to run the tests [is in GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/test-eql.yml):

- Automatically whenever there are changes in the `sql/`, `tests/`, or `tasks/` directories
- By manually running [the workflow](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions/workflows/test-eql.yml)

This is how the `test-eql.yml` workflow functions:

    check --> if_state
    if_state --> build_pass: All success
    if_state --> build_fail : Any failures
    build_pass --> [*]

```

You can also [run the tests locally](#running-tests-locally) when doing local development.

### Running tests locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you run the tests locally** you need to [set up a local dev environment](#set-up-a-local-development-environment).

To run tests locally with PostgreSQL 17:

``` shell
# Start a postgres instance (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run postgres:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run test

# Stop and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

You can run the same tasks for Postgres 14, 15, 16, and 17 by specifying arguments:

```shell
# Start a postgres 14 instance
mise run postgres:up postgres-14 --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests against postgres 14
mise run test --postgres 14

# Stop postgres and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

The configuration for the Postgres containers in `tests/docker-compose.yml`.

Limitations:

- **Volumes for Postgres containers are not persistent.**
  If you need to look at data in the container, uncomment a volume in
  `tests/docker-compose.yml`
- **You can't run multiple Postgres containers at the same time.**
  All the containers bind to the same port (`7543`). If you want to run
  multiple containers at the same time, you have to change the ports by
  editing `tests/docker-compose.yml`

## Releasing

To cut a [release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases) of EQL:

1. Draft a [new release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases/new) on GitHub.
1. Choose a tag, and create a new one with the prefix `eql-` followed by a [semver](https://semver.org/) (for example, `eql-1.2.3`).
1. Generate the release notes.
1. Optionally set the release to be the latest (you can set a release to be latest later on if you are testing out a release first).
1. Click `Publish release`.

This will trigger the [Release EQL](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions/workflows/release-eql.yml) workflow, which will build and attach artifacts to [the release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases/).


====


###

EQL is installed into the `eql_v1` schema.


## Types

### `public.eql_v1_encrypted`

Core column type, defined as PostgreSQL composite type.
In public schema as once used in customer tables it cannot be dropped without dropping data.

### Index terms

Each type of encrypted indexing has an associated type and functions

- `eql_v1.unique_index`
- `eql_v1.match`
- `eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1`
- `eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1_term`


## Operators

Operators are provided for the `eql_v1_encrypted` column type and `jsonb`.

```
eql_v1_encrypted - eql_v1_encrypted
jsonb - eql_v1_encrypted
eql_v1_encrypted - jsonb
```

The index types and functions are internal implementation details and should not need to be exposed as operators on the `eql_v1_encrypted` type.


--      eql_v1_encrypted = eql_v1_encrypted
--      eql_v1_encrypted = jsonb
--      jsonb = eql_v1_encrypted
--      ore_64_8_v1 = ore_64_8_v1

The jsonb comparison is handy as it automates casting.
Comparing ore_64_8_v1 index values requires that sides are functionalated:
eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1(...) = eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1(...)
In the spirit of aggressive simplification, however, I am not going to add operators to compare eql_v1_encrypted with the ore_64_8_v1 type.
In an operator world,  the index types and functions are internal implementation details.
Customers should never need to think about the internals.
I can't think of a reason to need it that isn't a version of "holding it wrong". (edited)




## Working without operators


### Equality

```sql
eql_v1.eq(a eql_v1_encrypted, b eql_v1_encrypted);
```





## Organisation

Break SQL into small modules, aligned with the core domains and types where possible

 - types.sql
 - casts.sql
 - constraints.sql
 - functions.sql
 - operators.sql

Operators are also functions, so some judgement is required.
The intent is to reduce file size and cognitive load.

In general, operator functions should be thin wrappers around a larger function that does the work.
Put the wrapper functions in `operators.sql` and the "heavy lifting" functions in `functions.sql`.

Tests should follow a similar pattern.



### Dependencies

SQL sources are split into smaller files.
Dependencies are resolved at build time to construct a single SQL file with the correct ordering.

Dependencies between files are declared in a comment at the top of the file.
All SQL files should `REQUIRE` the source file of any other object they reference.

All files must have at least one declaration, and the default is to reference the schema

```
-- REQUIRE: src/schema.sql
```



### Tables

### Configuration


`public.eql_v1_configuration`



EQL Design Note
Experimenting with using a Composite type instead of a Domain type for the encrypted column.
Composite types are a bit more capable. Domain types are more like an alias for the underlying type (in this case jsonb)
The consequence of using a Composite type is that the data is stored in the column as a Tuple - effectively the data is wrapped in ()
This means
on insert/update the data needs to be cast to eql_v1_encrypted (proxy mapping will handle)
on read the data needs to be cast back to jsonb if a customer needs the raw json (for data lake transfer etc etc)
Already built cast helpers so syntax is something like
    INSERT INTO encrypted (e) VALUES (
        eql_v1.to_encrypted('{}')
    );

    INSERT INTO encrypted (e) VALUES (
        '{}'::jsonb::eql_v1_encrypted
    );
