### How this project is organised

Development is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), both locally and [in CI](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions).

mise has tasks for:

- Building EQL install and uninstall scripts (`build`)
- Starting and stopping PostgreSQL containers (`postgres:up`, `postgres:down`)
- Running unit and integration tests (`test`, `reset`)

These are the important files in the repo:

```

Tests live alongside the individual SQL files, with a filename ending with `_test.sql`

We break SQL into small modules named after what they do.

In general, operator functions are thin wrappers around larger functions that do the actual work.
Put the wrapper functions in `operators.sql` and the larger functions in `functions.sql`.

Dependencies between SQL in `src/` are declared in a comment at the top of each file.
All SQL files should `REQUIRE` the source file of any other object they reference.

All files must have at least one declaration, and the default is to reference the schema:

```
-- REQUIRE: src/schema.sql
```

## Set up a local development environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you follow this how-to** you need to have this software installed:
>  - [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) ‚Äî see the [installing mise](#installing-mise) instructions
>  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ‚Äî see Docker's [documentation for installing](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

Local development quickstart:

``` shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language
cd encrypt-query-language

# Install dependencies
mise trust --yes

# Build EQL installer and uninstaller, outputting to release/
mise run build

# Start a postgres instance (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run postgres:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run test

# Stop and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

### Installing mise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete this step to set up a local development environment.

Local development and task running in CI is managed through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/).

To install mise:

- If you're on macOS, run `brew install mise`
- If you're on another platform, check out the mise [installation methods documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#installation-methods)

Then add mise to your shell:

```shell
# If you're running Bash
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# If you're running Zsh
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

We use [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) for faster installation of tools installed via `mise` and Cargo.
We install `cargo-binstall` via `mise` when installing development and testing dependencies.

> [!TIP]
> We provide abbreviations for most of the commands that follow.
> For example, `mise run postgres:setup` can be abbreviated to `mise r s`.
> Run `mise tasks --extended` to see the task shortcuts.

## Testing

There are tests for checking EQL against PostgreSQL versions 14‚Äì17, that verify:

- Adding, removing, and modifying encrypted data and indexes
- Validating, applying, and removing configuration for encrypted data and encrypted indexes
- Validating schemas for EQL configuration, encrypted data, and encrypted indexes
- Using PostgreSQL operators on encrypted data and indexes (`=`, `<>`, `@>`)

The easiest way to run the tests [is in GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/test-eql.yml):

- Automatically whenever there are changes in the `sql/`, `tests/`, or `tasks/` directories
- By manually running [the workflow](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions/workflows/test-eql.yml)

This is how the `test-eql.yml` workflow functions:

```

You can also [run the tests locally](#running-tests-locally) when doing local development.

### Running tests locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before you run the tests locally** you need to [set up a local dev environment](#set-up-a-local-development-environment).

To run tests locally with PostgreSQL 17:

``` shell
# Start a postgres instance (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run postgres:up --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests (defaults to PostgreSQL 17)
mise run test

# Stop and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

You can run the same tasks for Postgres 14, 15, 16, and 17 by specifying arguments:

```shell
# Start a postgres 14 instance
mise run postgres:up postgres-14 --extra-args "--detach --wait"

# Run the tests against postgres 14
mise run test --postgres 14

# Stop postgres and remove all containers and networks
mise run postgres:down
```

The configuration for the Postgres containers in `tests/docker-compose.yml`.

Limitations:

- **Volumes for Postgres containers are not persistent.**
  If you need to look at data in the container, uncomment a volume in
  `tests/docker-compose.yml`
- **You can't run multiple Postgres containers at the same time.**
  All the containers bind to the same port (`7543`). If you want to run
  multiple containers at the same time, you have to change the ports by
  editing `tests/docker-compose.yml`

## Releasing

To cut a [release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases) of EQL:

1. Draft a [new release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases/new) on GitHub.
1. Choose a tag, and create a new one with the prefix `eql-` followed by a [semver](https://semver.org/) (for example, `eql-1.2.3`).
1. Generate the release notes.
1. Optionally set the release to be the latest (you can set a release to be latest later on if you are testing out a release first).
1. Click `Publish release`.

This will trigger the [Release EQL](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/actions/workflows/release-eql.yml) workflow, which will build and attach artifacts to [the release](https://github.com/cipherstash/encrypt-query-language/releases/).

## Building

### Dependencies

SQL sources are split into smaller files in `src/`.
Dependencies are resolved at build time to construct a single SQL file with the correct ordering.

### Building a release locally

To build a release locally, run:

```bash
mise run build
```

This produces two SQL files in `releases/`:

 - An installer (`cipherstash-encrypt.sql`), and
 - An uninstaller (`cipherstash-encrypt-uninstall.sql`)

## Structure

### Schema

EQL is installed into the `eql_v1` PostgreSQL schema.

### Types

#### Encrypted column type

`public.eql_v1_encrypted` is EQL's encrypted column type, defined as PostgreSQL composite type.

This column type is used for storing the encrypted value and any associated indexes for searching.
The associated indexes are described in the [index term types](#index-term-types) section.

`public.eql_v1_encrypted` is in the public schema, because once it's used by a user in one of their tables, encrypted column types cannot be dropped without dropping data.

#### Encrypted index term types

Each type of encrypted index (`unique`, `match`, `ore`) has an associated type, functions, and operators.

These are transient runtime types, used internally by EQL functions and operators:

- `eql_v1.unique_index`
- `eql_v1.match`
- `eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1`
- `eql_v1.ore_64_8_v1_term`

The data in the column is converted into these types, when any operations are being performed on that encrypted data.

### Operators

Searchable encryption functionality is driven by operators on two types:

- EQL's `eql_v1_encrypted` column type
- PostgreSQL's `jsonb` column type

For convenience, operators allow comparisons between `eql_v1_encrypted` and `jsonb` column types.

Operators allow comparisons between:

- `eql_v1_encrypted` and `eql_v1_encrypted`
- `jsonb` and `eql_v1_encrypted`
- `eql_v1_encrypted` and `jsonb`

The index types and functions are internal implementation details and should not be exposed as operators on the `eql_v1_encrypted` type.
For example, `eql_v1_encrypted` should not have an operator with the `ore_64_8_v1` type.
Users should never need to think about or interact with EQL internals.

#### Working without operators

There are scenarios where users are unable to install EQL operators in your database.
Users will experience this in more restrictive environments like Supabase.

EQL can still be used, but requires the use of functions instead of operators.

For example, to perform an equality query:

```sql
SELECT email FROM users WHERE eql_v1.eq(email, $1);
```

### Configuration table

EQL uses a table for tracking configuration state in the database, called `public.eql_v1_configuration`.

This table should never be dropped, except by a user explicitly uninstalling EQL.

<!--
TODO(toby): probably move to README
TODO(toby): include examples of how to get data out of the table

EQL Design Note
Experimenting with using a Composite type instead of a Domain type for the encrypted column.
Composite types are a bit more capable. Domain types are more like an alias for the underlying type (in this case jsonb)
The consequence of using a Composite type is that the data is stored in the column as a Tuple - effectively the data is wrapped in ()
This means
on insert/update the data needs to be cast to eql_v1_encrypted (proxy mapping will handle)
on read the data needs to be cast back to jsonb if a customer needs the raw json (for data lake transfer etc etc)
Already built cast helpers so syntax is something like
    INSERT INTO encrypted (e) VALUES (
        eql_v1.to_encrypted('{}')
    );

    INSERT INTO encrypted (e) VALUES (
        '{}'::jsonb::eql_v1_encrypted
    );
